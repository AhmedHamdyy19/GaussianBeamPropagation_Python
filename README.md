# GaussianBeamPropagation_Python
The code simulates the propagation, transmission and reflection of Gaussian beam at the interface between two media. The beam will travel in air for a distance 2Zo, where Zo is the Rayleigh distance. Then, The beam will partially reflect and partially transmit at the interface of the second medium (glass). The transmitted beam will be simualted untill 2Zo and the reflected beam will be simulated at Zo.

#### Incident Beam at z = 0

#### Incident Beam at z = Zo

It can be noticed that as the beam propagates, the peak intensity decreases while the diameter of the beam inceases. precisely, the diameter increases by a factor of 1.4 as the beam propagates for a single Rayleigh distance.

#### Transmitted Beam at z = Zo

#### Transmitted Beam at z = 2Zo

Again, as the beam propagates, the peak intensity decreases while the diameter of the beam inceases.

#### Reflected Beam at z = Zo
